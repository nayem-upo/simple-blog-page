                    My country's name is Bangladesh. Bangladesh is a very small country huge population. It is a
                    medium-developed country in South Asia. We have a very good and progressing economy. It has
                    an area of 147,570 square kilometers. But it has a population of 164 million. That is huge
                    than the area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But it is still a very beautiful and peaceful country. People of Bangladesh are so friendly with
                    each other. This country has a glorious history of independence. We got independence from Pakistan
                    in 1971 after nine mothers' blood-shedding war. More than 3 million Bangladeshi sacrificed their
                    life in that genocide
                </p>
                <p>
                    But still, we were able to get our independence. After independence, the newly born country faced
                    lots of hard times and struggles. But it rises very well. Now Bangladesh is one of the best
                    countries to live in South Asia. There are so many beautiful spots to see in this country.
